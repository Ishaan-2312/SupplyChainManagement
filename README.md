# Supply Chain Management System

## Overview
The **Supply Chain Management System** is a **Spring Boot**-based backend that integrates **blockchain smart contracts** to ensure secure and transparent product tracking, delivery verification, and automated payments. The system enables real-time supply chain visibility by leveraging **Web3j** for blockchain interactions and **Spring Security** for authentication.

## Features
- **Product Tracking**: Monitors the movement of goods at each stage of the supply chain.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Ensures automated, tamper-proof transactions.
- **Automated Payments**: Payments are triggered based on delivery confirmation.
- **Real-time Data Storage**: Uses **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for maintaining supply chain records.
- **Authentication & Security**: Implements **JWT-based authentication** using **Spring Security**.
- **REST API for Supply Chain Operations**: APIs for product registration, shipment updates, and delivery validation.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Web3j
- **Blockchain**: Solidity Smart Contracts
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Build Tool**: Maven


## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/supply-chain-management.git
   cd supply-chain-management
   ```
2. Configure the database in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/supply_chain
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Deploy the smart contracts and update the Web3 configuration.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement **AI-driven demand forecasting**.
- Enable **multi-cloud deployment**.
- Introduce **IoT-based tracking integration**.
